RAD PDF SQL RELATED READ ME

RAD PDF requires a SQL Server database when using the PdfWebControl.

Run create_all_tables.sql using your target database to create all tables needed by RAD PDF.

The PdfWebControlLite (which includes nearly all features of PdfWebControl and is a more modern storage approach) can be used to avoid this requirement.
